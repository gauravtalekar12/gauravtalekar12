As a Data science intern at Triveni Turbines and a Master's student specializing in Climate Science at the esteemed Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, I am deeply passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive positive change. With a keen interest in machine learning and computer vision, I am dedicated to exploring innovative solutions in these domains
In my academic pursuits, I am currently working on my final year project, which focuses on renewable energy. By applying advanced data science techniques, I aim to develop novel approaches for optimizing renewable energy systems and enabling a sustainable future. This project allows me to merge my expertise in climate data science/Machine learning with my passion for renewable energy technologies.
I am always seeking new opportunities to collaborate on data-driven projects and explore the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and climate science. Together, we can drive innovation and make a meaningful impact in the engineering and renewable energy sectors. Let's connect and discuss how we can leverage data science to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.
